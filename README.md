## _The trolling extension_


One day I was chilling in my office when boss showed up to me and asked if I could create a chrome extension. I was free to choose it's purpose. So I made this


- Made with vanilla js
- Works on any site

## Features

- Replaces every image with me
- Links to my facebook

Since publishing it requires money and I hate spending, I pushed it to github.
You can clone this repo and load your extension page on chrome. Then, select Load Unpacked and point it to this directory.
